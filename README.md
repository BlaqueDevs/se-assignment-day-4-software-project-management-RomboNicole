3.it is stable and predictable in that all requirements are set and upfront
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa?
agile is better  when:
requierments asre likely to change s
if  frequent stakeholder feedback is necessary
if the projct demands creativity and flexibility since itd iterative nature allows team to try different approacheswhen necessary
when working with medium sized projects
waterfall is better when:
predictability and stability is key
when handling large projects
when the budget and timeline are fixed and cannot be adjusted
## Can you provide examples of each?
agile is better when dealing with ;software development since it has an iterative nature which allows it to add new featuers  to respond to real world feedback
product designing in the case of consumer electronics-this is because it is important to iterate frequently and gather as much feedback from the test groups and make modifications based on the user experience 

WATERFALL IS BETTER WHEN:
dealing withe construction  projects since it has a clear sequential process and well defined requirements from the start
dealing in manufacturing projects since in such once the project design is finalised the production process must follow a specific linear sequence

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? 
TestDrivenDevelopment-helps catch bugs earlier in the development processand also ensures thet codes arwritten meet the predefined requirements
Continuos integration and continuous delivery-hellps to catch integration errors early and ensures that code is always in a deployable state which reduces the risjks of defects in production
Code reviews-they help identify errors,suggest improvemnets and ensures that the codebase adhesres to the best practices
Regression testing-ensures that new features or updates are added and the existing software remains stable and functions as expected without introductin of new bugs
End to end testing-helps to ensure that all pafrts of the application interact correctly
## Why is it important to maintain high standards?
to ensure cutomer satisfaction
it helps to identify threats before the software is released hence reducing chances of significant risks from occuring
it allows smoother scaling of software as new features are added and ensures the software remains adaptable ro future needs
helps uphold a good reputation of the developlment team and the organisatiion.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning?
it establisehes clear objectives whuch ensurethe  stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the project is aimed at achievinhence preventing misunderstandings and misalignments during the project
sets clear expectations ensuring everuyone on board clearly understands what is expected of them out of the scope
helps to priotise taskes based on their importance to achieving the scope goals
## What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
aWBS is a hierachal decomposition pf the project scope into smaller manageable components
it iis useful in 
1,creating a clear and organised view of the work making it simpler for project managers to assigne responsibilities amd monitoring progress
helps project managers to assess the amount of resources required for particular tasks amd help in proper resources allocatins
helps in   identifyying risks associated with each work package
it assigns clear responsibility for each deliverable thus ensuring accountability and helps the project manager to hold the team responsible  for completing their allocated sections of the project
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
it gives a deatiled schedule when tasks or milestones should being completed enabling thehe team members to understand  the overall project timeline giving them a clear sense of direction and deadlines
it enables project managers to allocate resources more effectively and ensures that the resources are used optimally
helps in timing activities whuch assist in creating a budget
## and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
helps in flexibility  for adjustments 
offers a clear visual method of communicatimg the projects's status to the stakeholders
allows tracking of the task completion hence helps identifying delays. 

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address?why are these problems significant to your target audience?
 inefficiency in processes
 many organisations rely on outdated processes that sloew down operations amd increase the risk of errors 
 the significance of this that it leads to higher operational costs hence a software solutions should be adapted  to automate these processes and significantly boost your productivity
 DATA MANAGEMENT ACCESSIBILITY
 companies often struggle to organise and access vast ammounts of data which lead to data silos and inconsistency 
 sinificance is that inability to manage dataand access it is a huge hinderance in decision making hence they should use software that enables seamless data management and access in order to make informed decisions
 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
